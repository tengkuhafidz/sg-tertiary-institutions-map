# SG Tertiary Institutions Map (React)
This is a simple application listing all major local universities and polytechnics in Singapore. 
Aside from showing where they are in the map powered by Google Map's API, users would also get to see 3 places of attraction nearby them, as suggested by Foursquare's API.

This project is done as part of Udacity's Frontend Nanodegree course.
